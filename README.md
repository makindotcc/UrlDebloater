# UrlDebloater
Remove tracking params from URLs.

## Desktop (Windows/mac/linux)

### Features
- automatically extract links from clipboard and remove tracking parameters.
- unshorten tiktok per user links (https://vm.tiktok.com/PerUserGeneratedPath) to "anonymous" links (https://tiktok.com/@user/video/852438128934291)

### Todo
- installer
- act as default http url scheme handler, so opened link from non-browser program will be proxied through debloater before opening it in browser of your choice.
- optional [ClearURLs](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/) database support
- gui configuration
- tray icon with helpful shortcuts

## iOS
### Todo
i need to think about it. \
Maybe add shortcut action, so it can be painlessly run from home screen like here:
